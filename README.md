Bootstrap Theme for Spotweb

This project is created for a new Spotweb theme made with the Bootstrap Framework.
The many options and possibilities available in spotweb should still be available when the project is completed.
Completion however will take a long long time since the development of this theme has to go hand in hand with the spotweb project itself.
